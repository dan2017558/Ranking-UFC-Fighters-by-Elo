# Ranking-UFC-Fighters-by-Elo
This project uses UFC fight history data in order to create a fighter elo system.
An elo system is a more objective way to assess fighters from different weight classes when compared to the current pound for pound system.
Something unique about this approach is that it factors in the round the fight was stopped, rewarding faster fights with more elo.
The data used in this project was gathered from: http://www.ufcstats.com/statistics/events/completed?page=all
The project creates a database which fuels the application that is used to access the data.
